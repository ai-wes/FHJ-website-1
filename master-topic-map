    Weekly Deep Dives: 2 000–4 000-word analyses mapped to the 12 Pillars; always include “Future Human Application” + 0–100 Meter rating.

    Monthly Research Reports: PDF + interactive dashboard, sponsorship-ready (e.g., “State of Recursive AI Toolchains Q3 2025”).

    Foresight Streams: Live podcast + YouTube shorts; highlights auto-clipped by in-house LLM agent.

4. Tech & Data Infrastructure
Layer	Implementation Detail
Ingestion	RSS/Twitter API, arXiv, SEC, patent feeds, YouTube transcripts, custom Puppeteer scrapers
Classification & Tagging	FastText fallback → GPT-4o chain, mapped to 12-pillar ontology, stored in Chroma vector DB
